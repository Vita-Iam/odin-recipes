    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Varenyky are traditional Ukrainian dumplings filled with a variety of ingredients, 
        ranging from mashed potatoes to sweet cherries. These little pockets of dough 
        are boiled, then often sautéed or served with butter, sour cream, or caramelized 
        onions. The versatility of fillings makes them a comfort food favorite, enjoyed 
        by many for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil or melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling(potato and cheese)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, peeled and boiled</li>
        <li>1 cup farmer's cheese or ricotta</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter (for sautéing the onion)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. 
            Create a well in the center and crack the egg into it. Add the warm water 
            and oil (or melted butter), and gradually mix together until the dough 
            begins to come together. Knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, 
            until smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a cloth and let it rest for 
            30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> While the dough is resting, make the 
            filling. Sauté the finely chopped onion in butter until golden brown, about 
            5 minutes. Mash the boiled potatoes and mix them with the farmer's cheese. 
            Add the sautéed onions, then season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Once the dough has rested, roll it out 
            on a floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Use a round cutter 
            (a glass works well) to cut out circles about 3 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li><strong>Fill the Varenyky:</strong> Place a spoonful of the potato and cheese 
            filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over to create a 
            half-moon shape and press the edges firmly together to seal. You can crimp 
            the edges with a fork or pinch them tightly by hand to ensure they stay 
            closed during cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Varenyky:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a 
            boil. Carefully drop the varenyky into the boiling water in batches, being 
            sure not to overcrowd the pot. Stir gently to prevent sticking. Once they 
            float to the top, let them cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. Remove with a 
            slotted spoon and transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the varenyky warm with sour cream, a sprinkle 
            of fresh dill, or sautéed onions on top.</li>
