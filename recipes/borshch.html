    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Borshch is a classic, hearty Ukrainian beet soup with a rich, 
        tangy flavor that comes from the combination of beets, cabbage, 
        and a touch of vinegar. It’s typically served with a dollop of 
        sour cream and fresh dill, making it a warming, comforting dish 
        perfect for any season. The recipe varies by region and family, 
        but this version embraces the essence of the dish with its 
        vibrant color and depth of flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium beets, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 small head of cabbage, shredded</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil (for sautéing)</li>
        <li>1 liter (about 4 cups) of beef or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vinegar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> In a large pot, heat the vegetable 
            oil over medium heat. Add the onions and carrots, and 
            sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the grated 
            beets and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Broth and Simmer:</strong> Pour in the broth, then add the diced 
            potatoes and shredded cabbage. Bring the mixture to a boil, 
            then lower the heat to a simmer. Let it cook for 20-25 minutes 
            or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Season and Flavor:</strong> Stir in the tomato paste, vinegar, sugar, 
            garlic, and bay leaf. Adjust the seasoning with salt and 
            pepper. Add the smoked paprika if you're using it. Let the 
            soup simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes to let the flavors 
            meld together.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong> Taste the soup and adjust the vinegar and 
            sugar to your liking—borshch is traditionally slightly tangy 
            with a subtle sweetness. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Ladle the borshch into bowls, and serve hot with a 
            generous spoonful of sour cream and a sprinkle of fresh 
            dill on top.</li>
    </ol>
