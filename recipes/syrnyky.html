    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Syrnyky are soft, fluffy cheese pancakes made from cottage cheese or farmer’s cheese. 
        They're a popular breakfast or dessert in Ukraine and are often served with sour cream, 
        honey, or jam. Syrnyky are light and slightly sweet, with a rich, creamy interior and a 
        crispy golden crust from frying. They're incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed warm, 
        straight from the pan.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g (about 2 cups) farmer's cheese or cottage cheese (drained)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar (optional, depending on how sweet you want them)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder (optional, for extra fluffiness)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil or butter (for frying)</li>
        <li>Sour cream, honey, or jam (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine 
            the farmer's cheese (or cottage cheese), egg, sugar, vanilla extract, salt, 
            and flour. Mix everything until smooth. You may need to mash the cheese a 
            bit if it's too lumpy, and add a little more flour if the dough is too wet.</li>
        <li><strong>Form the Syrnyky:</strong> Dust your hands and a clean surface with a 
            bit of flour. Take a small amount of the cheese mixture (about 2-3 tbsp) and 
            form it into a small patty, about 2-3 inches in diameter. Repeat with the 
            remaining mixture, creating little rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the Pan:</strong> In a large pan, heat the oil or butter 
            over medium heat. Once it's hot, carefully place the syrnyky into the pan, 
            leaving space between each one.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry Until Golden:</strong> Fry the syrnyky for about 3-4 minutes on 
            each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Flip them carefully using a 
            spatula, so they don’t break.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove the syrnyky from the pan and place them on a 
            plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve warm with a dollop 
            of sour cream, a drizzle of honey, or your favorite jam.</li>
